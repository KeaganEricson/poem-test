<h1> Sonnet.</h1>
<h2>By Frances Anne Kemble (Fanny)</h2>
<p> I would I knew the lady of thy heart!
    <br/>She whom thou lov'st perchance, as I love thee, -
    <br/>She unto whom thy thoughts and wishes flee;
    <br/>Those thoughts, in which, alas! I bear no part.
    <br/>Oh, I have sat and sighed, thinking how fair,
    <br/>How passing beautiful, thy love must be;
    <br/>Of mind how high, of modesty how rare;
    <br/>And then I've wept, I've wept in agony!
    <br/>Oh, that I might but once behold those eyes,
    <br/>That to thy enamour'd gaze alone seem fair;
    <br/>Once hear that voice, whose music still replies
    <br/>To the fond vows thy passionate accents swear:
    <br/>Oh, that I might but know the truth and die,
    <br/>Nor live in this long dream of misery!</p>
